## Simple Spring Boot Groovy based web app

### There are 2 ways to start the application:

- With [Spring Boot CLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli)  installed you need HelloController.groovy only. Just run `spring run src\main\groovy\samples\spring\boot\HelloController.groovy`

- With Gradle you need all the files and start the application with command `gradlew run`

Check result at `http://localhost:8080/`
